   * TypeScript config for CLI scaffold templates.

   * These files are NOT part of the framework source — they are templates
   * that get copied into consumer projects by `npx @community-rss/core init`.
   * They depend on consumer-project context: `astro:actions`, `astro:schema`,
   * `@community-rss/core/*` sub-path exports etc., which are not resolvable
   * inside the package's own TypeScript environment.
   *
   * `noCheck: true` disables all diagnostics for these files in VS Code
   * (requires TypeScript ≥ 5.5). The files are validated in practice by
   * running them in a real consumer Astro project after scaffolding.
